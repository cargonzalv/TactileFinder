# Tactile Finder

This repo contains different iterations for the Tactile Finder project

The Tactile Finder Project is aimed to help visually impaired people find images that are optimal to be transformed to Tactile Graphics.

# Here you can see the description of each folder (project iteration)

1. tactile_finder_python: Tensorflow model running on Python. Based on the tensorflow for Poets example, using mobilenet for transfer learning. First basic iteration, works only on terminal. 90% accuracy

2. tactileFinderBrowser: TensorflowJS model training and running purely on the browser. No backend. Uses OpenGL (so it uses graphics card for processing).

3. tactileFinderNode: TensorflowJS model running on node and a react frontend. This is gonna be the final version of the project.
